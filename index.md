Namita Karnik

Namita Karnik is currently pursuing her Masters in Development Practice at 
the University of California, Berkeley. Her research interests include 
public health, climate change and the intersection of the two.

She has previously worked as a research analyst at the Economist 
Intelligence Unit, focusing on health policy and systems. Previously, as 
part of the graduate research analyst program, she has worked within three 
verticals within the company: country analysis, public policy and 
economics. 

She is hoping to learn data science over this semester and is excited to 
collaborate with others in her field.
